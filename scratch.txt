I dont feel like i have enough knowledge to answer task 2003
that is why I'm reviewing level 18 and level 19.
it's longer but it's gonna be well worth it.

                            input stream        output stream
works with bytes            inputstream         outputstream
works with characters       reader              writer

this actually helps me. I feel like i don't need to read the entire thing
I might just pick up the ideas i need

I saw code gym's solution and it was really elegant and clean and not a lot of fuzz
when i came up with the solution i was going by the suggestion of intellij to put try catches and stuff.
i feel like i still need to do certain things. i can't go on

i felt really inspired by the people in the comment section with their levels so high.
i bet i'd feel awesome once i reach level 41

what I'm doing right now is rereading the input output streams until i understand the level 20 solutions well enough
to talk about them

I'm working on ByteArrayOutputstream
